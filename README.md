# Complementary Fashion Recommendation System
Understanding the correct match between clothes is a complex task in computer vision. The works focussing on this as of today are dedicated 
towards predicting compatibility between product images, take for an example, an image containing a t-shirt and an image containing a pair of 
jeans. However these approaches ignore real-world scene images (e.g. selfies) which are hard to deal with due to their complexity, clutter, 
variations in lighting and pose but provide crucial context for the userâ€™s taste and style. 

In order to make it more suitable for the user to pick matching complementary products as expected on a specific occasion, here we have made use of CNNs, in particular the ones having attention mechanisms that have the ability to give higher weightage to certain image pixels. To start it off, we first use pininterest's STL dataset in order to train our neural network. After that we modify the dataset according to our need. Finally we compare our results with that of human performance in 
deciding complementary clothing. This allows us to come up with an idea of exactly how useful our work would be and with its successful implementation, we hope that the number and quality of user-friendly applications for providing users with a smooth and flawless shopping 
experience will improve significantly.
